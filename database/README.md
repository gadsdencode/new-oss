# Database Setup for Contact Form

This directory contains the database schema for storing contact form submissions in NeonDB.

## Setup Instructions

### For Vercel + Neon Integration

If you're using Vercel's built-in Neon integration, the database should already be configured. You just need to:

1. **Run the schema migration:**
   - Navigate to your Vercel dashboard
   - Go to your project's Storage tab
   - Select your Neon database
   - Open the SQL Editor
   - Copy and paste the contents of `schema.sql` into the editor
   - Execute the SQL script

### Manual Neon Setup

If you're setting up NeonDB manually:

1. **Get your connection string:**
   - Log into [Neon Console](https://console.neon.tech)
   - Navigate to your project
   - Copy the connection string (it will look like: `postgresql://user:password@hostname/dbname`)

2. **Set environment variable:**
   - Add `DATABASE_URL` to your `.env.local` file:
     ```
     DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@hostname/dbname
     ```
   
   - Also add it to your Vercel project settings:
     - Go to Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
     - Add `DATABASE_URL` with your Neon connection string

3. **Run the schema:**
   - Use the Neon SQL Editor in the console, or
   - Connect using your preferred PostgreSQL client and run `schema.sql`
