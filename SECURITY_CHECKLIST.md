# üîí Security Implementation Checklist

Use this checklist to verify that your LangGraph agent authentication is properly configured.

## ‚úÖ Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables

- [ ] Generate a secure API key using:
  ```bash
  node -e "console.log('langgraph-api-key-' + require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"
  ```

- [ ] Create `.env.local` in project root with:
  ```bash
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
  LANGGRAPH_API_KEY=your_generated_key_here
  LANGGRAPH_DEPLOYMENT_URL=http://localhost:8123
  ```

- [ ] Create `agent/.env` with:
  ```bash
  LANGGRAPH_API_KEY=your_generated_key_here
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
  ```

- [ ] Verify `.env.local` and `agent/.env` are in `.gitignore`

### 2. Code Implementation

- [‚úÖ] Authentication middleware created (`agent/src/auth.ts`)
- [‚úÖ] Next.js route updated to send API key (`app/api/copilotkit/route.ts`)
- [‚úÖ] LangGraph config updated (`agent/langgraph.json`)
- [‚úÖ] Environment variable validation added

### 3. Testing

- [ ] Run authentication test script:
  ```bash
  node test-auth.js
  ```

- [ ] Verify all three tests pass:
  - [ ] Test 1: Request without API key ‚Üí 401 ‚ùå
  - [ ] Test 2: Request with invalid API key ‚Üí 401 ‚ùå
  - [ ] Test 3: Request with valid API key ‚Üí 200 ‚úÖ

- [ ] Start both services and test manually:
  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- [ ] Check console logs for authentication messages:
  - [ ] Next.js shows no "CRITICAL SECURITY WARNING"
  - [ ] LangGraph agent shows "‚úÖ Authentication successful" on requests

### 4. Security Review

- [ ] API key is at least 32 bytes of random data
- [ ] API key is NOT hardcoded in source files
- [ ] API key is the SAME in both `.env.local` and `agent/.env`
- [ ] `.env` files are NOT committed to git
- [ ] Console logs show authentication is working
- [ ] Invalid requests are properly rejected with 401

### 5. Production Preparation

- [ ] Set `LANGGRAPH_API_KEY` in production environment (Vercel/Railway/etc.)
- [ ] Set `LANGGRAPH_DEPLOYMENT_URL` to production agent URL
- [ ] Enable HTTPS for all endpoints
- [ ] Consider adding rate limiting
- [ ] Consider IP whitelisting if applicable
- [ ] Set up monitoring for unauthorized access attempts

## üö® Common Issues

### Issue: "LANGGRAPH_API_KEY is not set" warning

**Fix:**
1. Ensure key is set in BOTH `.env.local` and `agent/.env`
2. Restart both services after setting the key
3. Check for typos in environment variable names

### Issue: 401 errors with valid key

**Fix:**
1. Verify the keys match in both files
2. Check for extra spaces or quotes in the key value
3. Ensure you've restarted services after changing .env files

### Issue: Authentication not being enforced

**Fix:**
1. Verify `agent/src/auth.ts` exists and exports `auth`
2. Check `agent/langgraph.json` has the auth path configured
3. Look for errors in the LangGraph agent console logs

## üìã Quick Verification Commands

```bash
# Check if .env.local exists and has the key
grep LANGGRAPH_API_KEY .env.local

# Check if agent/.env exists and has the key
grep LANGGRAPH_API_KEY agent/.env

# Run authentication tests
node test-auth.js

# Start both services
npm run dev
```
